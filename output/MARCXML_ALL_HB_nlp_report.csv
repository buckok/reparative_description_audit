In the print, the white abolitionists are portrayed as unsuspecting and bewildered innocents who find themselves entirely out of their depth.

Dundas, wearing a kilt, offers Pitt a glass of wine (in place of stanching his wound); a bottle of 'Port' projects from his coat-pocket. The officer behind holding the British flag is identified by Lord Holland as Chatham and the man who supports him as Powys, noted for his propensity to tears. The White Horse of Hanover on the flag is more conspicuous than in West's picture, and a scroll inscribed 'Magna Chart[a]' has been added.  In the group facing Pitt the place of the Mohawk Indian seated on the ground is taken by Loughborough. The two men who lean forward to Wolfe, pointing back to the messenger with the news of victory, are dressed as running-footmen in livery and hold the long sticks with the head enclosing an egg carried by these men. Ink-pots are slung across their shoulders by bands inscribed 'Ist Treasury Runner' and '2d Tre . . .', showing that they are the two Secretaries to the Treasury, George Rose and Charles Long. Grenville, in peer's robes, stands between Lord Mansfield and Windham, who supports him. A large bonnet-rouge lies on the ground. The couple who stand on the extreme right watching Pitt with clasped hands are Richmond and a man with a wooden leg. Richmond, in general's uniform, his bald head contrasting with the luxuriant hair of West's corresponding figure, has a cannon slung to his back to indicate his Mastership of the Ordnance in which, however, he had been succeeded by Cornwallis. His weeping companion has been identified as Wilberforce, though his wooden leg might indicate Brook Watson. The background differs from West's picture.

The last two are women: 'la Comtesse de Blot' and 'la Comtesse de Buffon' who wears feathers in her hair, and turns her head to gaze at Orleans, the huntsman, whose mistress she was. Orleans rides a clumsy hack, blowing a horn, and is dressed in the French manner, with the boots and whip of a French postilion (in place of his accustomed English riding-dress).
